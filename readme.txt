Homework 1: Data Set Analysis

>Operation
	The program is simple and intuitive: to launch, simply run a class or run the included.jar file, and a window appears, prompting for an input, either a set of numbers (SEPARATED BY A SPACE) or a file name containing a set of numbers (SEPARATED BY A SPACE). Output will then appear, and if you would like to save the output to a txt file, simply input the name at the bottom where it is prompted and press the save button. If the file name already exists, the old file will be replaced. The file goes to the project source's root directory. A numbers.txt is included for easy assessment.
	
Note: The data set being analyzed is not displayed in the output for concision, but will be displayed if the output is saved for reference.

>Process
	The main learning point of this project for me was the use of the Swing library, which I am completed unfamiliar with. There was a lot to learn in this project, most notably the small annoyances and restrictions when using specific layouts in Swing. Still, the issues were easy to work around, and I was able to create a clean UI. Interaction between classes was easy to set up by giving each class a reference to the master class, and needless to say, working with arrays and mathematical calculations was pretty basic; no explanation needed. I did learn, however, the true implication of pointers, as when I tried to directly copy an array into another, it only copies the address, and editing the copied array actually changes the value of the original array; this caused inconsistencies that took me a while to find and fix. 
	The last step was polishing. I tried to make the interface as clean and intuitive as possible and make the output format clean and readable. 

>Marketing
	The app has beautiful dark GUI! The app fully embraces the object oriented nature of Java; though it could be more flexible, it really is modular! Anyway, remember that the data sets are to be SEPARATED BY A SPACE ONLY. If its not well at least it prints errors to the output ;)
