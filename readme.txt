CS2110 HW2

Collaboration: done by Baizhou and Baichuan Hou

To launch, launch the runnable jar OR run the main.class. The program is a simulation in which 3 fictional factions, the Zerg, Protoss, and Terran, participate in a world market where 3 goods are traded between 3 factions. There is an arbitrary demand generated for each cycle, and a price that is adjusted accordingly. It is not a perfect equilibrium, but it is a representation of the market. 

The structure and design workflow can be found in the Design.pdf found int he source.
