To launch, run the .jar file or run Main.class through eclipse. Included is a test.txt file with can be read to easily test the functionality of the program. Names in the file to be read is to be separated by ONLY A SPACE, and will be sorted into queue in the order which they are read in the file. The buttons at the bottom allow the names in queue to be sorted alphabetically without disrupting the current order of the queue.

The names being printed are actually just the names of customers, and thus can be effortlessly extended to access other data as needed, such as position in queue, or other information that needs to be stored in the Customer class. There is also the option to search for a specific person in queue, thus easily allows confirmation of whether or not a specific person is in queue. The queue is a normal linear queue, but allows for various features such as removing from a specific position in queue, searched by position in queue or by name, or any other info that can be extended through the Customer class.

Unfortunately, we did not have time to work on implementing the second question, as we spent too much time creating a modular framework, but I am confident that with the existing modularity, creating 2 dimensional queues and multiple queues is not an issue at all.
